#### This is my  Udacity project as part of Advance African Scholarship Program powered by Acces Bank. This code concern Python, it's the second project writen by myself for the graduation of the Nanodegree in Programming for Data Science.

**Please, feel free to test it and give me some feedback in order to help me learn more and do impactfull research in the field of Data Science.**

#### Project description

In this project, I used  Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States Chicago, New York City, and Washington (the data set concern year 2017 specially the first six month of trafics). The code is made of some functions to import the data and answer questions by computing descriptive statistics and visualisations. This code is interactive.

The following are the requirements to get started with your bikes data set analysis.

1. You should have git bash installed or use Anaconda Prompt

2. Once the command prompt is displayed, use  cd command to get the directory of **bikeshare_2.py** file downloaded.

3. Type the  following command  `python bikeshare_2.py` and then enter. To get the code run without any problem, you should have three csv file namaly **chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv  and washington.csv** in the same directory with the bikeshare_2.py file.

4. Run the **bikeshare_2.py** file

5. The code will ask you first to choose which data do you want to analyse, secondly will provide in which month you want to pull the data from 
and lastly you should give  as well the day.

For the rest, the code is interactive as possible to guide you achive your goal.


To achive this work, I make use of my udacity classroom courses, stack overflow, W3Schools and google for undertanding of some phython method and syntax.

**Looking forward to hearing from you soon**

**Best Regards**
